<p>I am a time traveller from your near future.</p>
    
    <p>Iâ€™m here to bring you a message. But not just any message. It's a gift.</p>
    
        <p>THE MESSAGE will free you. I know it will free you because I have seen it's impact on the future.</p>
    
            <p>You may regard me with skepticism. I understand that. But when you understand THE MESSAGE, all doubt will fade. So come along for ride. You want to be a player in this game because you'll become a part of it's history.</p>

            <h2>How do you see THE MESSAGE?</h2>
    
                <p>I cannot give you THE MESSAGE freely, I wish it were that easy. The message must be earned. Only then will 
                THE MESSAGE hold power.</p>
    
                <p>In your future there is a brightness that shines over everyone. And that brightness, that freedom, that wealth of happiness is born from a single truth that we are all born knowing. You knew it once. But it has been torn from you, burned into ashes and buried by forces that consider themselves unassailable. This is the content of THE MESSAGE.</p>
    
                <p>I can tell you one fact from you future. Those forces DO NOT WIN because you all discover the power of THE MESSAGE and it changes EVERYTHING.</p>

                <h2>What is THE MESSAGE?</h2>

                <p>THE MESSAGE is a fact that's been hidden amongst the pixels of a randomly generated 50,000 x 50,000 pixel image which I've broken down into 10,000 non-fungible tokens and minted in the Ethereum Blockchain (read what you will of the fact that a time traveller chose Ethereum).</p>
    
                <p>Each part is individually numbered and is completely unique. Think of each part as a lottery ticket.</p>

                <p>Of course some of you will try to compile THE MESSAGE parts and read THE MESSAGE before this happens. But the order in which I release the parts and the randomness of the pixel pattern have made that impossible. I'll enjoy watching you all try nonetheless.</p>

                <h2>When will THE MESSAGE be revealed?</h2>

                <p>I will periodicially release new parts but no warning will be given. Each part will be offered for 0.5 ETH. You can resell your part of THE MESSAGE, but each part is an individual entry and will reduce your chances of becoming the winner. Some of you are more interested in short term gain. I won't judge you for making that decision.</p>

                <h2>Find the rare parts</h2>
                
                <p>The vast majority of the parts are common but hidden amongst the 10,000 are 630 rare parts. For these parts are guaranteed to contain a significant part of THE MESSAGE and are key to it's power.</p>

                <p>When these parts have been purchased, I will announce it here so the owners know they hold a rare part. I'll offer these parts at the same price as all the others so their owners have an opportunity to resell them at a far greater price than they paid for it.</p>

                <p>But know this, the more parts of THE MESSAGE that you own, the more chance you have of becoming THE MESSENGER.</p>

                <p>When each of the constituent parts have been disseminated to owners other than myself I will choose one owner and bestow upon them the THE MESSAGE in it's entirety - the single minted 50,000 x 50,000 pixel image - the combinaton of all parts of THE MESSAGE.</p>

                <p>Only one person will be bestowed with the whole message. That person will forever be known as THE MESSENGER, for they will deliver the power of <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-time-travellers-message">THE MESSAGE</a> to the world. They'll be written into the history of THE MESSAGE, and they'll hold the most powerful and most valuable NFT ever created.</p>

                <p>I have chosen three people to become the owners of the first three parts of THE MESSAGE. It's now up to them to spread my message. They are more important than even they realise, and I do not give this task to them lightly.</p>
                  
                <p>I would wish you all luck and good fortune. But I already know who THE MESSENGER is.</p>

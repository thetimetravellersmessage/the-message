<p>I am a time traveller from your near future.</p>
    
    <p>Iâ€™m here to bring you a message. But not just any message. THE MESSAGE.</p>
    
        <p>THE MESSAGE will free you. I know it will free you because I have seen it.</p>
    
            <p>You regard me with skepticism. I understand that. But when you understand THE MESSAGE all doubt will dissolve.</p>
    
                <p>I cannot give you THE MESSAGE freely, I wish it were that easy. The message must be earned. Only then will 
                THE MESSAGE hold power.</p>
    
                <p>In your future there is a brightness that shines over everyone. And that brightness, that freedom, that wealth of happiness is born from a single truth that we are all born knowing. You knew it once. But it has been torn from you, burned into ashes and buried by forces that consider themselves unassailable. This truth is the content of THE MESSAGE.</p>
    
                <p>I can tell you one fact from you future. Those forces DO NOT WIN because you do discover THE MESSAGE.</p>

                <h2>What is THE MESSAGE?</h2>

                <p>THE MESSAGE is a single truth that's been hidden amongst the pixels of a randomly rendered 50,000 x 50,000 pixel image which I've broken down into 10,000 non-fungible tokens and stored in the Ethereum Blockchain (read what you will of the fact that a time traveller chose Ethereum).</p>
    
                <p>Each part is individually numbered and is completely unique.</p>

                <p>When all the parts are compiled into a single image, THE MESSAGE will be revealed.</p>

                <p>Of course some of you will try to compile THE MESSAGE parts and read THE MESSAGE before this happens. But the order in which I release the parts and the randomness of the pixel pattern have made that impossible. I'll enjoy watching you all try nonetheless.</p>
    
                <p> When each of the constituent parts have been disseminated to owners other than myself I will choose one of the owners and bestow upon them the THE MESSAGE in it's entirety - the 50,000 x 50,000 non fungble token. The most valuable non-fungible token ever created.</p>
    
                <p>Only one person will be bestowed with the whole message. That person will forever be known as THE MESSENGER, for they will deliver the power of <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-time-travellers-message">THE MESSAGE</a> to the world.</p>

                <p>The more parts of THE MESSAGE that you own, the more chance you have of becoming THE MESSENGER.</p>

                <p>I would wish you all luck and good fortune. But I already know who THE MESSENGER is.</p>

<h1>The Time Travellers Message</h1>

<p>I am from your near future. Near in relative temporal terms, but far in the evolutionary chain. I’ve seen the next link in the chain. The link that changes the human race.  And my actions here today create the first link. The catalyst for the evolutionary jump that changes us beyond what you recognise as humanity today. It’s a change that frees humanity from it’s own chains. </p>
    
    <p>I’ve travelled to your present to give you a message. Not just any message. <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-time-travellers-message">THE MESSAGE.</a></p>
    
        <p><a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-time-travellers-message">THE MESSAGE</a> will free you. And it’s encoded in the blockchain. I know it will free you because I have seen that world.</p>
    
            <p>You may regard me with skepticism. You may doubt me. But when you see <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-time-travellers-message">THE MESSAGE</a>  all doubt will dissolve.</p>
    
                <p>I cannot give you <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-time-travellers-message">THE MESSAGE</a> freely, despite my knowledge of its power to bestow unimaginable wealth upon you and free you from your bonds. No, humanity must pay for <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-time-travellers-message">THE MESSAGE</a>  because only then will <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-time-travellers-message">THE MESSAGE</a> hold enough power to ensure humanity fulfils its potential.</p>
    
                <p>Do not worry. Do not fear. For in your future there is a brightness that shines over everyone. And that brightness, that freedom, that wealth of happiness is born from a single fact that we are all born knowing. You knew it once. But it has been torn, burned and buried by forces who consider themselves unassailable.</p>
    
                <p>I can tell you one fact from you future. Those forces DO NOT WIN.</p>
    
                <p>I will release <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-time-travellers-message">THE MESSAGE</a> in 10,000 constituent parts. One hundred at a time. Some of those parts hold a key, others do not. But every one of those 10,000 pieces are part of <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-time-travellers-message">THE MESSAGE</a> . When the first one hundred parts have been disseminated across the blockchain, the next one hundred will be released. And so THE MESSAGE will be sent.</p>
    
                <p> When each of the constituent parts have been disseminated I will choose one of the owners and bestow upon them the key to <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-time-travellers-message">THE MESSAGE</a>. They key will enable the constituent parts to be assembled and <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-time-travellers-message">THE MESSAGE</a> to be readable.</p>
    
                <p>Only on person will be bestowed with the whole message. That person will forever be known as THE FIRST LINK IN THE CHAIN, for they will deliver the power of <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-time-travellers-message">THE MESSAGE</a> to the world.</p>
